# Web Development Project Overview

This project is a dynamic website developed using the **Django web framework**. For database management, **MySQL** is utilized as the local database hosted on the system. Although I have experience working with cloud services such as **Azure** and **AWS**, I opted to use a locally hosted database for this project as it does not currently leverage paid cloud services.

The website's front-end incorporates **HTML** to enhance visual appeal and user experience, providing a clean and responsive interface. This project showcases the integration of Django with MySQL and demonstrates my ability to create full-stack applications while balancing performance and design considerations.
